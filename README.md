# Thyroid Disease Detection Project

## Overview

This project is aimed at developing a Thyroid Disease Detection system using machine learning techniques and Flask, a web framework in Python. The system allows users to input relevant medical data, and it provides predictions on the likelihood of a patient having thyroid disease.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 
- Flask 
- Scikit-Learn 
- Pandas 
- NumPy 

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```markdown
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/2611ansh/thyroid-disease-detection.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd thyroid-disease-detection
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the Flask application:

   ```bash
   python application.py
   ```

2. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000/` to access the Thyroid Detection App.

3. Enter the patient's medical data in the provided form and click the "Predict" button to get the disease prediction results.

## Project Structure

The project directory is structured as follows:

```

```

## Model Training

Details about model training, data preprocessing, and feature engineering can be found in the `model_training.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook in the `src` directory. You can explore and modify this notebook for model improvement.

## Deployment

The Flask application can be deployed on a web server or cloud platform for public access. Be sure to follow deployment best practices and secure your application if it's accessible on the internet.
